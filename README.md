Special thanks to my teachers, who did an excellent job of teaching me React, and to **Joshua Smith**, who will be leaving GA soon and will be greatly missed. I also received much help from the folks at Stack Overflow and Twitter/X, who helped me grasp important concepts, particularly for Tailwind CSS. Finally, thanks to the documentation teams at React and MDN for their thorough resources.
